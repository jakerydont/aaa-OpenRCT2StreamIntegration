# OpenRCT2 Stream Integration Relay
Project aiming to add the OpenRCT2 Twitch stream integration back in using a plugin.
OpenRCT2 plugins cannot communicate with Twitch directly, this project is the relay that will communicate with Twitch, and the OpenRCT2 plugin. Get the [OpenRCT2 Stream Integration Plugin](https://github.com/oli414/StreamIntegrationPlugin) here.

## Prerequisites
